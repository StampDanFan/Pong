# Pong
This is a simple game of Pong made with Python. This program uses tkinter.

# How to Play
To start, run the code. Then, click on the window that appears. Use the left and right arrow keys to control the paddle. Try to keep the ball on the top. If the ball hits the bottom, game over! The game will tell you your score, which is the number of times your ball hit the paddle.
